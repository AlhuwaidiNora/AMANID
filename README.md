1. Project Overview

The proposed solution to address the high prevalence of phishing scams in Saudi Arabia when using online banking and mobile wallet services is the development of a general infrastructure for e-IDs, known as AMANID. AMANID aims to save user data using modern technologies and authenticate user accounts using a combination of digital identity provided by the bank, password, fingerprint, and security question. By implementing these measures, AMANID enhances the security of the application registration and login processes, providing a secure, convenient, and flexible solution for digital identity verification that is trusted by banks and organizations worldwide[1].

1.2 Problem Description

Phishing scams have become a growing concern in Saudi Arabia. These cyber attacks involve criminals sending fraudulent messages, emails, or texts to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card details, or personal information. In Saudi Arabia, phishing scams often masquerade as emails from reputable sources like banks, government agencies, or well-known companies. These emails typically contain prompts for recipients to click on a link or provide personal information.

Falling victim to a phishing scam can have significant consequences. Once criminals obtain access to sensitive information, they can use it to steal money, commit identity theft, or engage in other fraudulent activities. While many organizations in Saudi Arabia have implemented security measures to prevent phishing attacks, individuals may still be vulnerable, especially if they are unfamiliar with the signs of a phishing scam and inadvertently provide sensitive information to criminals.

Overall, phishing scams pose a significant threat to individuals and organizations in Saudi Arabia, and there is a need for increased awareness and education about these types of attacks to help mitigate the risk.

1.3 Proposed Solution

The proposed solution offers several enhancements to traditional bank and user account authentication processes, including:

Quick authentication of user accounts through digital identity, password, and security question.
Fast, easy, and secure authentication of bank transactions through the application.
Improved security in banking transactions.
User data storage using Firebase, which offers advantages such as real-time database updates, enabling collaboration and data synchronization across connected devices. Firebase is a powerful development platform that provides features and services for building high-quality applications quickly and easily. Its real-time database, authentication features, cloud functions, hosting services, and analytics capabilities contribute to creating dynamic, responsive, and engaging applications for web and mobile platforms.
Reduced dependency on a large number of employees for bank auditors' supervision.

1.4 Project Objectives

The main objective of the project is to create an application that enables users to easily protect their information using modern technologies such as digital identity, passwords, and security questions. The specific objectives of the proposed application are as follows:

Assisting banks in easily saving user data on a secure and protected database.
Leveraging the benefits of digital identity, including convenience, security, privacy, personalization, and efficiency. As more services move online, digital identity plays an increasingly vital role in the digital landscape.
Implementing security questions as an additional layer of protection to safeguard online accounts from unauthorized access. These questions are easy to set up, flexible, and customizable to meet the needs of both users and service providers.
Allowing users to review all their transactions within the application.
